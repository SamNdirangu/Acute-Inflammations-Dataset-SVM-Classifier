# Acute-Inflammations-Dataset-SVM-Classifier

# Dataset Brief
This data was created to aid development of an algorithm which will perform the presumptive diagnosis of two diseases of urinary system. It features 120 samples each with 5 features that are used to diagnose two conditions at the same time. Of each of the 2 conditions there are 2 classes representing whether having the disease or not

# About the code
The code prepares and processes the dataset from a csv file. The trained model is evaluated using K-fold cross-validation, theres is no hold out validation performed. A confusion matrix is also generated to produce the recall,precision and F1 score of the model.

The code is properly structured, well commented and symbolic variables used allowing beginners too have an easy time understanding it.
